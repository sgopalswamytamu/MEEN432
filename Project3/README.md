# Project 3 Folder
This folder contains MATLAB scripts and Simulink models for Project 3 of MEEN 432 Automotive Engineering.
The following scripts should be ran in order:
1) **init.m**
2) **initDriveCycle.m**
3) **p3_runsim.m**

Running in this order initializes car data for the longitudinal model of the vehicle and information regarding a Drive Cycle. The last script runs the Simulink model **p3_w1_car.slx** and produce a plot that shows the simulated velocity as a function of simulation time along with the Drive Cycle plotted with a +- 3 mph error band
